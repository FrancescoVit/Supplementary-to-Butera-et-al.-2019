*DESCRIPTION*


This repository was created with the aim of storing and making public the scripts and command that were used for microbiota analysis in the manuscript "IL-13 mRNA tissue content identifies two subsets of adult ulcerative colitis patients with different clinical and mucosa-associated microbiota profiles". 

* Command used for raw reads pre-treatment and OTUs picking can be found here in the file [from_seqs_to_OTU.sh](https://github.com/FrancescoVit/Supplementary-to-Butera-et-al.-2019/blob/master/from_seqs_to_OTU.sh)
* Command used in R for data analysis can be found in the file [Colitis_analysis.R]()
